## About StockTuna

**StockTuna** is a Python library currently in pre-alpha development, designed for processing stock market and securities historical data. It integrates with the Alpaca API to provide users with real-time and historical market data, facilitating the development of sophisticated algorithmic trading strategies. Visit the official website at [stocktuna.com](http://stocktuna.com) for more information and resources.

### Features of StockTuna

- **Paper and Live Trading Modes**: Two subclasses (`PaperTuna` and `LiveTuna`) make it easy to switch between paper trading and live trading.
- **Alpaca API Integration**: Direct access to real-time and historical market data via Alpaca.
- **Indicator Functions**: Includes functions for calculating **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**.
- **Predefined Market Indices**: A `cannedtuna.py` file contains hardcoded lists of stock symbols for major market indices, such as the Dow Jones, NASDAQ 100, NYSE FANG, and S&P 500.

### Available Classes and Functions

- **PaperTuna**: Initializes a `PaperTuna` object for paper trading using Alpaca's paper trading API.
- **LiveTuna**: Initializes a `LiveTuna` object for live trading using Alpaca's live trading API.
- **StockTuna**: The core class that handles API connection and provides utility functions for data analysis.
  - **`get_api_connection(base_url)`**: Establishes a connection to the Alpaca API using provided credentials.
  - **`sma(bars, period)`**: Calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA) over a specified period, returning a list of values.
  - **`sma_chart(bars, periods, symbol)`**: calculates and graphs a stock price against the SMAs for all input SMA periods. `periods` is an arbitrarily large list of integers representing all SMAs to be graphed. Chart is saved in `./examples/charts/`.
  - **`ema(bars, period)`**: Calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over a specified period, returning a list of values.
  - **`ema_chart(bars, periods, symbol)`**: calculates and graphs a stock price against the EMAs for all input EMA periods. `periods` is an arbitrarily large list of integers representing all EMAs to be graphed. Chart is saved in `./examples/charts/`.
  - **`rsi(bars, period)`**: Calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the given period, and returns a list of the values.

### Example Code

Within `./examples/`, **`moving_average_crossover_strategy.py`**, **`exponential_moving_average_crossover_stragey.py`**, and **`relative_strength_index_strategy.py`** demonstrate the use of `PaperTuna` to fetch historical stock data, calculate the specified indicator, and identify buy/sell signals based on the data. Using hardcoded stock symbols or stock indices from cannedtuna.py, the script backtests the strategy with one year of historical data. It simulates trades using a $100,000 starting balance, tracks gains and losses, and calculates final portfolio performance, providing insight into the strategyâ€™s effectiveness over time. Simply update the `symbol` variable for the stock to test, change the hardcoded indicator variables `short_period` and `long_period`, and run the script.

Also within `./examples/`, the files **`moving_average_crossover_strategy_bruteforce.py`**, and **`exponential_moving_average_crossover_strategy_bruteforce.py`** demonstrate the use of the SMA and EMA functions to find the best parameters for use in these strategies. Hardcoded `short_period_range` and `long_period_range` variables can be modified to change the search space, while the `index` variable can be used for testing against a specific stock, a list of stocks, or a hardcoded index in `CannedTuna`. Examples of each can be found within these files. Simply update these variables, and run the script.

### Example Results

Within `./results/`, **`moving_average_crossover_strategy.md`**, and **`exponential_moving_average_crossover_stragey.md`**, the results of the bruteforcing scripts run against hardcode market indices from `CannedTuna`. These show the best SMA and EMA parameters for each stock market index found in `CannedTuna`.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and start using StockTuna:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockTuna.git
   cd StockTuna
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

3. **Set Up API Credentials**:
   StockTuna requires an Alpaca API key and secret to access market data. You have two options:
   - **Option 1**: Directly provide credentials in your code. Example:
     ```python
     from stocktuna.stocktuna import PaperTuna
     tuna = PaperTuna(alpaca_key='your_alpaca_key', alpaca_secret='your_alpaca_secret', verbosity=2)
     ```
   - **Option 2**: Use a local `api_auth.py` file:
     - Rename `examples/api_auth_template.py` to `api_auth.py`.
     - Add your Alpaca API credentials to the file.

4. **Run the Example**:
   Navigate to the `examples/` directory and run `moving_average_crossover_strategy.py` to see how to use StockTuna to fetch data and generate SMA plots:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   python3 moving_average_crossover_strategy.py
   ```
   This script demonstrates how to use the library to pull historical stock data, calculate moving averages, and visualize them along with buy and sell signals. The default example uses the `PaperTuna` subclass for paper trading.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- An Alpaca API account (sign up at [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets)).

## To Do

- **Expand Indicator Functions**: Need more mathematical functions like SMA, EMA, etc.
